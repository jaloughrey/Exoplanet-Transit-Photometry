# Discovering-an-Exoplanet-from-Cardiff

- generalise the code to work for any transit, just need star positions and some other parameters
    - go through script and remove all unnecesary features
    - keep the final light curve plot and the parameter table but remove all other outputs
    - then create a parameter file with star positions and other constants
    - read this into the script and use these so it works for any transit aslong as star positions are updated.

- create seperatre plotting and photometry scripts
    - all other outputs go in seperate script, analysis based outputs and calibration
      
- fix the database query script
    - learn how to use the nasa expolanet database package
    - think about the columns i need it to return
    - chatgpt
    - 
- add the data reduction script maybe as last feature and generalise this aswell

-upload the data somewhere onine and provide link.
